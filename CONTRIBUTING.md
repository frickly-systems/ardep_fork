## Communication

We use GitHub to handle bug reports, feature requests, questions and
general discussions (via the "issues" and "discussions" features of
GitHub) as well as for managing code and documentation improvements
(via pull requests). Transparent, inclusive and open communication is
important to us; thus, all project-related communication should happen
exclusively on GitHub and using the English language.

In the context of project-related discussions, please respect our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/foss/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
