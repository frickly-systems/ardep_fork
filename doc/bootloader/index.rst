Overview
++++++++

The ARDEP bootloader uses MCUboot and supports different firmware update mechanisms depending on the board version:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Ardep v2.0.0 and later

        **Default boot logic: UDS Firmware Loader**

        V2 boards come with an :ref:`on_board_debugger` and use UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) over CAN as the default firmware update mechanism via the :ref:`firmware_loader`.
        
        The BOOT jumper (PE4) triggers entry into the UDS firmware loader for UDS updates.

    .. tab:: Ardep v1.0.0

        **Default boot logic: USB DFU**

        V1 boards use USB DFU (Device Firmware Update) as the default firmware update mechanism.
        
        The BOOT jumper (PE4) triggers entry into USB DFU mode for firmware updates via the ``dfu-util`` tool.

        .. note::
            V1 boards can optionally be configured to use the UDS firmware loader by explicitly enabling it in sysbuild configuration.
   
Building the bootloader
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The bootloader can be built using sysbuild together with a sample for flashing. To reset the board to a delivery state, use 

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -b ardep samples/led -p --sysbuild

to build the :ref:`led_sample` and bootloader

If you want to build for a specific board version, change the `-b` argument accordingly:

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -b ardep@1.0.0 samples/led -p --sysbuild


.. _flashing_the_bootloader:

Flashing the bootloader
+++++++++++++++++++++++


.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Ardep v2.0.0 and later

        The bootloader is flashed via the on-board debugger using the `west flash` command.

        Just run:

        .. code-block:: bash

            west flash

        This will flash the bootloader to the board.
        

    .. tab:: Ardep v1.0.0

        The bootloader is flashed with an external debug probe (e.g. J-Link) using the `west flash` command.

        For this connect the SWD Pins of the ARDEP board to the debug probe an run:

        .. code-block:: bash
           
            west flash -r {runner}

        The Pinout of the SWD connector is printed on the boards backside.

        See the `board.cmake` file under `boards/arm/ardep` for more info about supported debuggers/runners.


.. _bootloader_mode:

USB DFU Bootloader Mode (ARDEP v1)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

    This section applies primarily to **ARDEP v1** boards, which use USB DFU as the default firmware update mechanism.
    
    **ARDEP v2 and later** boards use the :ref:`uds_bootloader` by default and have an :ref:`on_board_debugger`, allowing standard flashing via ``west flash``.

In USB DFU mode, the ARDEP board does not load any firmware and waits for a firmware upgrade via the ``dfu-util`` tool.
This is handy if your firmware is broken and you can't update it from there.

It is helpful to see the Bootloader console output on ``UART-A`` for this.


Entering USB DFU Bootloader Mode
=================================

To enter the USB DFU bootloader mode, pull the ``PE4`` pin (labeled *BOOT*) to a LOW state (by setting the jumper) while power-cycling or pushing the Reset button.

When the red LED lights up permanently, the board is in USB DFU bootloader mode.

On ``UART-A`` you will see the following output:

.. code-block::

    *** Booting Zephyr OS build zephyr-vx.y.z ***
    I: Starting bootloader
    I: Waiting for USB DFU
    

.. note::

    ``UART-A`` is the output that is forwarded by the on-board debugger.

.. note::

    If you flashed the UDS firmware loader on the ARDEP v1 board, the bootloader will enter the UDS firmware loader instead of USB DFU mode when the BOOT jumper is set.
    This means, that flashing via USB DFU is only possible when not using the UDS firmware loader and according bootloader.

Upgrading the Firmware via USB DFU
===================================

- Build the firmware you want to flash (assuming it is in the *build* directory)
- Perform the upgrade with ``west flash``
- Wait for the upgrade to complete


.. _uds_bootloader:

UDS Firmware Loader
+++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

    **ARDEP v2.0.0 and later**: The UDS firmware loader is the **default** boot logic. You can build any application with sysbuild and it will automatically include the UDS firmware loader.
    
    **ARDEP v1.0.0**: USB DFU is the default. To use the UDS firmware loader, you must explicitly enable it in the sysbuild configuration and flash the application, bootloader and firmware loader via an external debug probe, see :ref:`flashing_the_bootloader`.

For applications that require firmware updates over UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services),
a :ref:`firmware_loader` is provided which can be built using sysbuild.

It is not recommended to build the firmware loader independently as the bootloader needs configuration options to handle the firmware loader correctly.

For demonstration purposes, build the :ref:`uds-sample` using sysbuild (which contains a ``sysbuild.conf``), which automatically builds the firmware loader:

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -b ardep samples/uds -p --sysbuild

.. note::
    On ARDEP v1 boards, the default dfu-util flasher will not work to flash the bootloader, see :ref:`flashing_the_bootloader`

If you wish to build your own application using the UDS Firmware loader, enable the sysbuild boot logic configuration like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -b ardep <path-to-your-app> -p --sysbuild -- -DSB_CONFIG_BOOT_LOGIC_UDS_FIRMWARE_LOADER=y

Or more permanently by creating a ``sysbuild.conf`` file in your application folder and adding the following content:

.. code-block::

    SB_CONFIG_BOOT_LOGIC_UDS_FIRMWARE_LOADER=y

.. important::
    When using the default UDS instance (``CONFIG_UDS_DEFAULT_INSTANCE=y``, enabled by default on ARDEP boards), the firmware loader switch is handled automatically on programming session requests unless disabled with ``CONFIG_UDS_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_DISABLE_SWITCH_TO_FIRMWARE_LOADER=y``.
    
    If you create a custom UDS instance or disable the automatic switch, you must call ``uds_switch_to_firmware_loader_with_programming_session()`` in your diagnostic session control action handler when a programming session is requested.


Sysbuild
++++++++

With sysbuild, multiple applications (i.e. bootloader, main application and sometimes firmware loader) are built together using just one build command.

More information is available in the official `Zephyr Sysbuild documentation <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/4.2.0/build/sysbuild/index.html>`_.

Sysbuild basics
===============

There are multiple things that differ from a normal west build:

First, there are multiple targets for using menuconfig, one for each "domain":

.. code-block:: bash

    # Main application menuconfig
    west build -t menuconfig

    # Bootloader menuconfig
    west build -t mcuboot_menuconfig

    # (If enabled) Firmware loader menuconfig
    west build -t firmware_loader_menuconfig

    # Sysbuild menuconfig (also contains the config option for enabling the firmware loader)
    west build -t sysbuild_menuconfig


Second, you can switch between domains when debugging by specifying the domain:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Debug main application
    west debug

    # Debug bootloader
    west debug --domain mcuboot

    # (If enabled) Debug firmware loader
    west debug --domain firmware_loader

Finally, when flashing, you can either specify no domain, which flashes all domains in series or you can specify a domain to flash only that domain:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Flash all domains (bootloader, firmware loader (if enabled) and main application)
    west flash

    # Flash only bootloader
    west flash --domain mcuboot

    # (If enabled) Flash only firmware loader
    west flash --domain firmware_loader

    # Flash only main application (when building sample/uds the sample-name would be uds)
    west flash --domain <sample-name>

.. important::
    Note that on ARDEP v1 boards, only the main application can be flashed using the ardep runner. This also means that the bootloader and (if needed) firmware loader must be flashed using an external debug probe, see :ref:`flashing_the_bootloader`.
