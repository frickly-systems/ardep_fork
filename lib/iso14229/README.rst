ISO14229 Library
################

This library is a thin wrapper around this `iso14229 library <https://github.com/driftregion/iso14229>`_.
Most notable features are:

- event driven
- exposing only a small API, making it easy to use
- manages its own thread to not require regular polling by the user (optionally)

For more information on how to setup and use the wrapper, see the :ref:`iso14229-sample` and its tests.

For more information on the underlying library, see its `repository <https://github.com/driftregion/iso14229>`_ and `documentation <https://github.com/driftregion/iso14229/tree/main/docs>`_.
